/*Write a function to accept an integer (32 bits) and operation type to do the following and return the result to main function.
    - Set 2 bits from nth bit position, if operation type is 1
    - Clear 3 bits from nth bit position, if operation type is 2
    - Toggle MSB, if operation type is 3
   You can consider the below function prototype,
    - bit_operations(int num, int oper_type, int pos);*/
